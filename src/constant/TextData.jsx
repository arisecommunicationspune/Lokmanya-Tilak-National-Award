Murty shared how Tilak’s ideals guided her work with over 3,000 Devadasis in Karnataka, who collectively built a bank from small savings, earning ₹8 lakhs in profit. “This unity reflects Tilak’s belief in collective will.” She also remembered visiting Tilak’s prison cell in Mandalay, where he wrote Gitarahasya, calling it a symbol of courage and wisdom. “Behind Tilak’s greatness was the quiet strength of his wife, Satyabhama, whose sacrifices must be remembered.” “Tilak’s life shows how to overcome adversity with resolve. Had he not joined the freedom movement, he would have been a professor of mathematics. We are fortunate to have such a towering figure in our history.”",

    para:"When India gained independence, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had said, “India does not lack resources; what is needed is intelligence to set priorities and a strong will.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership over the past eight years has echoed Patel’s vision. Inspired by the philosophy of Antyodaya and Swadeshi, Modi has focused on inclusive development, ensuring food security, cultural preservation, and national dignity.Modi’s vision rests on four pillars: infrastructure, national identity, spiritual strength, and defence. India is witnessing record-breaking infrastructure growth—highways, railways, tunnels, ports, and airports—with 50 km of highways being built every day, and a target of 2 lakh kilometres by 2025. Iconic religious and cultural sites like Ayodhya, Kashi Vishwanath Dham, and Char Dham are being rejuvenated, reinforcing India’s spiritual fabric. Internationally, Modi has elevated India’s stature. His foreign visits—from the US to Central Asia and the Pacific Islands—have attracted investment and built strategic partnerships. He is the first Indian PM in decades to visit countries like Australia, Fiji, and Mongolia, and has hosted global leaders like Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin. His call for International Yoga Day was endorsed by a record 177 countries at the UN. Domestically, transformative schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana, Make in India, Digital India, and Swachh Bharat have empowered the poor, boosted entrepreneurship, improved sanitation, and expanded digital access. Labour reforms and social security schemes have supported small enterprises and workers. In defence and self-reliance, Modi has taken historic steps to secure India's sovereignty while embracing the dream of becoming a 'Vishwaguru'. In many ways, he is fulfilling Lokmanya Tilak’s vision of Swaraj through Swadeshi, and the Lokmanya Tilak National Award conferred upon him is a fitting tribute to his transformative leadership.",

Pune has been a cradle of revolution, from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to Mahatma Phule and Savitribai Phule. This morning, I sought blessings at Shri Dagdusheth Ganapati, a symbol closely linked to Tilak’s vision of cultural awakening. Receiving an award in Tilak’s name, in a city so steeped in his legacy, brings a sense of immense responsibility. I dedicate this honour to 140 crore Indians and pledge to work with full commitment toward their aspirations. The monetary component of the award has been donated to the Namami Gange Abhiyan. Tilak was a towering symbol of courage, intellect, and nationalism. His call—“Swaraj is my    birthright”—ignited India’s self-confidence and inspired leaders like Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi. Through his writings and public movements, he awakened a national consciousness that continues to guide us. His Gita Rahasya taught us resilience and purposeful action. Even in prison, his unshaken spirit turned faith into strength. Today, India moves forward with confidence, from vaccine leadership to becoming the fifth-largest economy. Citizens' power has transformed a trust deficit into a trust surplus. As we mark 75 years of independence, may Tilak’s ideals continue to guide us in building a strong and self-reliant India. Thank you for this honour. I bow to this sacred land and reaffirm my commitment to the path shown by Lokmanya Tilak. ",

His Geetarahasya offered a spiritual reinterpretation of the Bhagavad Gita, awakening the nation’s consciousness. “Lokmanya Tilak was a true patriot and visionary. At Patanjali, we seek to emulate his example. I have declined many awards but accepted this one because it carries his name. I come not merely to receive an award, but to draw strength from his legacy,” Balkrishna declared. “I am no historian, but a follower of our freedom fighters who sacrificed family, comfort, and life for the country. We breathe freely today because of their sacrifices.” “In British India, people feared speaking out. Yet Lokmanya boldly proclaimed: ‘Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it.’ His voice inspired countless youth to join the freedom movement. The Lal-Bal-Pal trio ignited nationalism and Swadeshi across India. Even Mahatma Gandhi, initially sceptical, embraced Swadeshi under popular influence, carrying it nationwide.” Balkrishna warned, “Today’s foreign companies enslave us economically and culturally. They undermine our traditions, values, and women’s dignity, exploiting them in advertisements. This is not progress—it is cultural erosion.” “Yoga was once mocked as old-fashioned and impractical. TV channels doubted its appeal. Today, yoga is among the most-watched content on Indian television. Going against the tide is never easy. Lokmanya did it—he challenged the British when no one else dared. That is why he was named ‘Lokmanya’—trusted and beloved by the people.” “To stand for truth requires spiritual power. Lokmanya’s truth brought independence. Today, Patanjali seeks to bring economic and spiritual freedom through Yoga, Ayurveda, and the Swadeshi spirit,” he concluded.',

Indigenous defence, space, science, and atomic capabilities blossom from this philosophy.” He traced India's tumultuous history, from colonial subjugation, the revolts of 1857, to the gradual failures of delayed industrialisation. Recognising Lokmanya Tilak’s Four Principles, Dr. Pillai reminded everyone of their power to mobilise intellectuals and citizens to challenge imperialism and strengthen the nation.

Speaking at the ceremony, Shri Shinde eloquently articulated the significance of both Pitroda’s achievements and Lokmanya Tilak’s enduring legacy. His words are quoted here in full reflection. “Had Lokmanya Tilak not taken a bold and unyielding stand for India’s independence,” Shinde remarked, “our nation may very well have continued its struggle into the latter half of the twentieth century, much like other colonies.” He underscored that Lokmanya Tilak not only envisioned freedom, but also dreamed of a rejuvenated Indian society. “Tilak awakened a slumbering nation, instilling in its people the resolve for self-governance. He fought the British with intellect and resolve, firmly believing in the inevitability of Swarajya, yet deeply concerned about the nation’s future thereafter.” Shinde continued, noting that Tilak had a profound awareness of contemporary European developments and was keenly observant of the Industrial Revolution. However, he recognised that mere industrial progress would not suffice if the wealth generated flowed abroad or remained in the hands of a privileged few. His vision for inclusive development was anchored in the belief that societal progress must uplift all sections, not just the elite.",

I accept this award with great pride and humility. To speak of Lokmanya Tilak in Pune, where his legacy lives vividly, is no easy task. You all know his life and contributions well. Yet, I wish to highlight how deeply he valued human dignity and unity. Tilak believed in the transformative power of farmers, workers, and artisans—those often neglected by society. He rejected caste-based discrimination and worked tirelessly to unite the masses for national progress. He respected religious traditions, advocating reform through empathy rather than confrontation. To him, governance meant trust among citizens. Democracy, he insisted, was not a Western import but rooted in India’s own culture of equality and justice. His compassion for the underprivileged was boundless. He urged the middle-class youth to connect with rural India and uplift the marginalized. Today, as the middle class enjoys greater comfort, we too bear a similar responsibility. Until we bridge this gap, the vision of true Swaraj—of Tilak and Gandhi—remains unfulfilled.",

At the time, dairy farmers in Anand were exploited by the monopoly firm Polson. Inspired by Sardar Patel, a cooperative was formed under the Kheda District Milk Producers' Union. Kurien, though a mechanical engineer, accepted the challenge of making milk powder from buffalo milk—a feat experts deemed impossible. With guidance from Tribhuvandas Patel and tireless effort, Kurien succeeded. Pandit Nehru personally lauded the breakthrough. Kurien's work transformed the rural dairy landscape. Amul emerged as a national brand, and profits were reinvested in education and healthcare for farmers. At the suggestion of PM Lal Bahadur Shastri, Kurien established the NDDB and launched Operation Flood, making India the world’s largest milk producer and self-sufficient in dairy. In the 1970s, amid shortages of essentials like oil, Kurien spearheaded an edible oil revolution, forming oilseed cooperatives and launching the Dhara brand—despite fierce resistance from vested interests. His model was later extended to tree growers and salt workers. To train rural leaders, Kurien founded IRMA in Anand, creating Asia’s leading institution for rural management. His vision placed the supply chain in the hands of farmers, ensuring empowerment through democratic, autonomous cooperatives. Committed to integrating science with agriculture, Kurien believed markets should serve people, not the other way around.

He warned that challenges like hunger, inequality, and conflict still plague India, making Lokmanya Tilak’s ideals more relevant today. Kurien believed in the power of people-led cooperatives and envisioned more “Anand-like” models across the country, insisting that crises often sow the seeds of future success. During a time when cheap European dairy imports threatened Indian farmers, Kurien sold them at Indian prices to protect local producers and fund future initiatives, marking the launch of Operation Flood’s second phase. For Kurien, true development meant empowering rural India with opportunities, not just machines. He challenged bureaucratic centralisation, famously questioning why NDDB should be based in Delhi, advocating instead for bold, grassroots-led actions.

As we observe the 75th death anniversary of this great son of India, I bow to a leader who lives on in the hearts of millions. Tilak’s vision transcended time and borders—his message remains as relevant globally today as it was in colonial India. A Vedantist at heart, Tilak believed that liberty was sacred. For him, Swarajya was not merely a political demand but a moral duty—a dharma. His Home Rule movement, anchored in Swadeshi, National Education, and Boycott, awakened a colonised people and gave nationalism its soul. Today, in a world dominated by multinational forces, his call for Swadeshi is more urgent than ever. If we ignore it now, we risk losing our economic independence once again. Tilak’s nationalism was inclusive and rooted in unity. He used festivals like Ganeshotsav and Shiv Jayanti to bring people together, irrespective of religion or caste. A devout Hindu, he still stood firm for secularism and the upliftment of the oppressed. In today’s fractured political climate, where nationalism is often reduced to a slogan and institutions are losing public trust, I often wonder—what would Tilak say? Would he not be anguished?

Referring to Gitarahasya, Sharma highlighted how Tilak interpreted Lord Krishna’s Karma Yoga as a guide to secular and principled living. He reminded that even Jinnah once trusted Tilak as his lawyer, a sign of his inclusive leadership. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, he said, “Tilak was like an ocean. Upon hearing of his death, Gandhi exclaimed, ‘My strongest protector has gone.’ That alone shows Tilak’s enduring influence on India’s freedom struggle.”",

Grounded in the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, his philosophy emphasized self-study (svadhyaya), community service, and spiritual upliftment.

A scholar and visionary, he represented India at the 1954 World Philosophical Congress in Japan, where his presentation on Vedic philosophy drew global admiration. Despite an invitation from Nobel Laureate Dr. Arthur Holly Compton to propagate his ideas in the U.S., Dada chose to dedicate himself to India's spiritual upliftment. He founded Tattvajnan Vidyapeeth to foster youth rooted in spiritual values and led training camps that sparked a cultural renaissance amid rising materialism. Dada believed that while science advanced materially, it failed to address inner emptiness. His solution: Swadhyaya, a practice of self-study and selfless devotion that cultivated joy, self-reliance, and unity beyond caste or creed. A key manifestation was the Bhakti Pheri—spiritual pilgrimages spreading divine thought to remote communities. For over three decades, thousands of self-funded Swadhyayees travelled across India and abroad, quietly transforming lives. Dada’s teachings birthed tangible initiatives: Vrikshamandirs (tree temples), Amrutalayas (community kitchens), Yogeshwar Krishi (spiritual farming), and cooperative projects in fisheries, dairies, education, and sanitation—all sustained without ego or ownership. He coined the term Apaurusheya Lakshmi—divine, ego-free wealth—to describe this unique community economy. Rejecting materialism’s dehumanizing effects, Dada insisted that every person carries divine worth. Swadhyaya was his way of reigniting this inner dignity, reminding people that God dwells within them and that every human being is a temple of the Divine. His message was simple yet profound: rediscovering this inner bond with God can transform society from within.",

He urged society to bridge gaps not with sympathy but with love and dignity, empowering the marginalized through belonging rather than charity. Paying tribute to Lokmanya Tilak, he said, “During a time of darkness, Tilak held the Gita in one hand and proclaimed, ‘Swaraj is my birthright,’ inspiring independence and self-awareness.” Athawale asserted that wealth alone cannot uplift society—what’s needed is love, confidence, and a shared sense of purpose. “If a man is broken and for sale, how can he build a nation?” he asked, underlining that law and money are not enough—only fraternity can rebuild the nation. Calling the award a blessing for the people, he pledged the monetary reward to uplift tribal and underprivileged communities. Reflecting on democracy, he noted it is hollow without dignity and identity for the 90% without power or wealth. They must feel seen, valued, and essential to society. He criticized sectarianism and ego-driven politics, likening society to a leaking bucket—ineffective unless its divisions are healed. He urged a balance between religious zeal and rational thought, where both faith and reason coexist for true reform. He concluded: “Tilak used the Gita to awaken the masses. Let us carry forward that mission—with devotion, dignity, and unity.”",

Vaidya also clarified that Dharma in Indian tradition implies a moral code, not religion, and that secularism in its true form respects all faiths equally. Appeasement in its name, however, distorts its essence. Vaidya criticised the misuse of the term “communal” for nationalists and the flawed post-independence adoption of Western systems, which led to political corruption and erosion of self-reliance.

A close associate of Jayaprakash Narayan, Lohia, Acharya Narendra Dev, and Yusuf Meher Ali, he also drew inspiration from Maharashtra’s thinkers like Sane Guruji, S. M. Joshi, and Nanasaheb Gore. Despite these associations, Limaye remained fiercely independent, valuing open debate but always reserving his own judgment. A keen constitutional thinker, Limaye often guided the press and public through complex political issues. His well-known debates with Ashok Mehta in the Praja Socialist Party—especially over the role of the opposition in underdeveloped democracies—led to the formation of the Samajwadi Party alongside Lohia. In 1955, he led Satyagrahis during the Goa Liberation Movement, was arrested and brutally beaten by Portuguese police, and sentenced to ten years by a military court. He spent time in Fort Aguada prison, reading and reflecting until his release in 1957. Parliamentary Brilliance and Work in Bihar - Limaye later made Bihar his political base, where he was known affectionately as “Madhuji.” Collaborating with leaders like Karpuri Thakur, he organised landless labourers, especially in Munger, and fought the feudal landlord system. In Parliament, he earned a reputation as a brilliant orator and constitutional expert. His mastery of procedure, eloquent Hindi, and quiet but forceful manner commanded respect across party lines. He exposed corruption and corporate misconduct with relentless precision, prompting even Rajya Sabha members like Shakuntala Paranjpye to attend Lok Sabha sessions just to hear him. Though blamed by some for the Janata Party split, even critics acknowledged his principled stance. He always put ideals above personal ambition. Later Years and Legacy - Health issues slowed him down after 60, but not his intellect. Over eight years, he authored 14 books in English—among them Cabinet Government in India and The Birth of Non-Congressism, now standard texts in political science. Despite withdrawing from active politics, his counsel remained sought after by senior leaders.

Calling it a “collective suicide,” he demanded the withdrawal of the Maharashtra Assembly’s unanimous resolution in support of such boards. Limaye also lambasted the Planning Commission, blaming it for stalling progress, especially the Konkan Railway project. He accused it of functioning merely as a placement body for economics graduates and failing basic objectives like modernizing land records from the First to Eighth Five-Year Plans. He lamented the weak representation of Maharashtra in national politics, contrasting it with the legacy of leaders like Ranade, Gokhale, and Tilak. Apart from figures like Yashwantrao Chavan and Nath Pai, he noted that many Maharashtrian MPs lacked the linguistic and intellectual capability to make an impact in Delhi.

He rejected resentment against migrants, citing the widespread cultural contributions of Marathis from Tanjore to Banaras. Though rich in artistic traditions, he felt Maharashtra lagged in business, politics, and industry. Recalling how he once recommended Bhimsen Joshi and Kumar Gandharva for a music festival and was accused of bias, Limaye asserted that true art transcends language and caste. Both artists, although Maharashtrian in identity, hailed from North Karnataka but thrived under Maharashtra’s cultural openness—a tradition that embraced legends like Abdul Karim Khan and Alladdiya Khan as well.

A Philosopher’s Quiet Path - Later, Achyutrao led a meditative life in Varanasi—writing, teaching, and reflecting in silence. He declined roles in the Planning Commission and even the Presidency, stating, “How can I be your President when I am bound by non-violence?” His life was a rare confluence of spiritual depth and fearless activism—forever etched in India’s legacy.",

Recalling the profound impact of Geetarahasya during his imprisonment, Patwardhan called its introduction “unmatched in clarity and logic.” He also highlighted Tilak’s pioneering yet controversial work in Vedic astronomy and comparative philosophy, admired even by Max Müller. Patwardhan warned that India now faces a moral decline more dangerous than colonial rule—marked by bribery, black money, and decaying values. “The erosion is self-inflicted,” he declared. “Consumerism is corroding our collective conscience.” Rejecting the saying “as the king, so the people,” he urged introspection: “As the people, so the polity.” He lamented the drop in educational quality despite institutional growth and warned of wasted human capital. Calling for a moral and intellectual awakening rooted in action, not slogans, he concluded: “To honour Tilak is to live his values. If a mind like his emerged today, would we even recognize it?” ",

After early education locally, he moved to Mumbai for higher studies at Wilson College. Even as a student, he showed strong convictions, opposing the mandatory Bible reading, and left his B.A. mid-way to join Mahatma Gandhi’s non-cooperation movement. However, disillusioned with Gandhi’s methods, Dange turned towards Marxism. His 1921 critique, Gandhi versus Lenin, drew the attention of Manavendranath Roy. In 1922, he launched The Socialist, India’s first communist newspaper, marking the formation of the Indian Socialist Labour Party. His activities led to his arrest in the Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case. In Mumbai, Dange forged strong connections with industrial workers and allies like R. B. Latwala and the Patel brothers. After his release in 1927, he rejuvenated the labour movement and co-founded Kranti, a Marathi weekly promoting socialist ideas. He became Joint Secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, consolidating his influence among mill workers. Arrested again in the 1929 Meerut Conspiracy Case, he served seven years in prison. Despite the Communist Party of India being banned, he continued his work underground. After Independence, Dange became a powerful voice in Parliament, championing labour rights with courage and clarity. A committed nationalist, he actively supported the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement and led the Goa Liberation Committee. He stood firmly with Nehru during the 1962 Indo-China War. In 1964, during the CPI split, Dange sided with the Soviet-aligned faction and became the party’s President. However, internal differences led to his ouster in 1971.",

During a cholera epidemic in Mumbai, Dange and his peers approached Lokmanya Tilak to help with relief efforts. Tilak, after ensuring parental consent, entrusted them with distributing medicines among workers—an experience Dange cherished deeply, marking the beginning of his ideological bond with Tilak. Defending Tilak and Challenging Moderates- Dange actively defended Tilak’s ideology. At a Town Hall meeting chaired by Dinshaw Wacha, he and fellow students demanded that Tilak be heard. When the chair tried to silence Tilak, they disrupted the session in protest. Though the press criticized them and Gandhi urged an apology, Dange refused, standing firm in his convictions, unlike his peer Nimbkar, who expressed regret.Legacy of Labour and Loyalty - Tilak believed in the power of the masses, and Dange upheld this vision throughout his life, notably through his work with the All India Trade Union Congress. On 30th July 1920, as Tilak lay critically ill, Dange kept vigil outside his home. He later dedicated himself to serving the working class, honouring the values Tilak stood for.",

I remember my father calling Annie Besant Putna Mavshi and forbidding us from attending her meetings in Mumbai.

Dange even admitted to receiving “two or three hundred rupees” from his father to fund these escapades. Reflecting on political missteps, he openly acknowledged the CPI’s support for the British during World War II and the resulting backlash. Turning to Shri Jayantrao Tilak, he joked: “Here I sit—with the Governor on my right and Jayantrao on my left. Even if someone throws a stone, I’m safe!” Graciously accepting the award, he added with a smile: “I’m glad even my disciple, Godavari Parulekar, got it before me.

Gandhi herself had laid its foundation stone in 1971.

Though I am a humble man, it is my privilege to accept this award on behalf of a figure so monumental as Smt. Indira Gandhi.” He underscored Smt.

He urged the audience to uphold her legacy by continuing her work: “She sanctified the nation’s unity with the ultimate sacrifice of her life. It is our collective duty to carry forward her unfinished work so that we may honour her memory and free ourselves from the debt we owe to her legacy.” Governor Rao also reflected on the gradual erosion of public memory: “It is unfortunate that the younger generation is forgetting the contributions of leaders like Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. In a few years, even Indira Gandhi may be remembered only on her birth anniversary, November 19th. But the fault is not theirs—it is ours. When Mahatma Gandhi is remembered only on October 2nd, and Pandit Nehru only on November 14th, we are failing to instill the spirit of these sacrifices in our youth.”_ He concluded with a call to action: “Today is a significant day—a day to remember Lokmanya Tilak, the architect of India’s independence. Pune should take immense pride in this legacy. It is our solemn responsibility to ensure that the torch of memory continues to shine through the generations.”",

She expressed deep concern that the younger generation remains largely unaware of the monumental contributions made by freedom fighters like Tilak. “This is not ancient history,” she stated emphatically, “but a living legacy that continues to shape the destiny of our nation.” Recalling the colonial period, she observed, “Tilak arose at a time when India was gripped by hopelessness and subjugation. It was he who breathed courage and conviction into the hearts of Indians. His clarion call of ‘Swaraj is my birthright’ reverberated from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Calcutta to Karachi.” Ms. Parulekar passionately cautioned against the rising separatist tendencies in states like Punjab, Assam, and Mizoram. She declared unequivocally that had a separate Khalistan been declared, she would have undertaken a hunger strike—even unto death—to resist such fragmentation. Her unwavering commitment to national unity drew resounding applause from the audience. She also voiced her anguish over the continued marginalization of the rural poor—particularly those who had once stood at the forefront of India’s freedom struggle. “Millions of agricultural labourers remain unemployed, underpaid, and voiceless. The benefits of independence have not reached them,” she noted with sorrow. Highlighting the historic role of the tribal communities of Ambegaon and Rajgurunagar, Ms. Parulekar reminded the audience of their readiness to support the revolutionary actions of Vasudev Balwant Phadke. “The rural and tribal populations were the backbone of our freedom struggle,” she said. “Yet, even decades after independence, they continue to be shackled by poverty.” She concluded with a call to action—urging for a renewed struggle rooted in social awareness, systemic reform, and inclusive development, ensuring that the dream of Swaraj truly reaches every citizen of India.",
