      "Shri S.M. Joshi (Shridhar Mahadev Joshi; 12 Nov 1904 – 1 Apr 1989) was a stalwart of India’s socialist and independence movements, hailing from Junnar, Maharashtra. A student at Fergusson College, Pune, he was deeply involved in the freedom struggle—leading protests like the 1929 movement to allow Dalit entry into Parvati Temple and actively opposing the Simon Commission and Salt Satyagraha, which resulted in multiple imprisonments . He played a key role in founding the Congress Socialist Party (1934), the Rashtra Seva Dal, and later served as General Secretary of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti, championing a united Marathi-speaking state. Joshi also held elected offices, including MLA in the Bombay Assembly (1957–62) and MP from Pune (1967–71).",

      "He was the inaugural recipient of the Lokmanya Tilak National Award (first awarded in 1983) in recognition of his lifelong dedication to social equality, secularism, and grassroots democracy. His fearless advocacy for Dalit temple entry, workers’ rights, and regional unity embodied the reformist and inclusive spirit of Lokmanya Tilak. This honor acknowledged Joshi’s principled leadership, selfless activism, and enduring impact on Maharashtra’s and India’s social and political landscape."
